'''You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.

Example 1:

Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
Output: 2
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.'''


def countAsterisks(s):
    lst = []
    for i in s:
        if '|' not in lst:
            lst.append(i)
        elif '|' in lst and i == '|':
            lst.pop()
    return lst.count('*')


s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
print(countAsterisks(s))
