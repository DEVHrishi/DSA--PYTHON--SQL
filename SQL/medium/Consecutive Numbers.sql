Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |

Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.*/

-- Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT distinct(t1.num) as ConsecutiveNums FROM logs t1, logs t2 , logs t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id+1 AND t2.id=t3.id+1 AND t1.num=t2.num AND t2.num=t3.num
